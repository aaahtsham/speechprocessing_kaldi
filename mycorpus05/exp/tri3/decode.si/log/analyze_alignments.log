The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 23.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 91.9% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 17.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.4 hours of data, or 0.3 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 8.9% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (21,32.3,93)
