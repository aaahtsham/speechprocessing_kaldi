The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 13.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 93.2% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 7.9% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.6 hours of data, or 1.4 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 5.5% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (9,20.8,79)
