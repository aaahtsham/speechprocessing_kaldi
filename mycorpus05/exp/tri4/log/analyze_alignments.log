The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 12.9% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 93.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 7.5% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.6 hours of data, or 1.4 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 5.5% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (8,19.7,78)
