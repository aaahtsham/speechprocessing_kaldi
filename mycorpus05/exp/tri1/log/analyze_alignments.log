The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 16.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 92.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 10.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.6 hours of data, or 1.4 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 5.4% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (15,26.4,87)
