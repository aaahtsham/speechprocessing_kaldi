The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 17.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 92.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 11.2% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.6 hours of data, or 1.3 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 5.1% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (20,31.1,92)
