The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 18.9% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 86.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 6.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 5.0 hours of data, or 4.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 2.8% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (15,22.8,62)
