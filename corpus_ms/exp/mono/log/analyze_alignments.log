The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 19.9% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 86.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 7.5% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 5.0 hours of data, or 4.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 2.8% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (20,28.4,74)
