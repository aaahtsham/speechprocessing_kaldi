The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 25.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 85.7% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 12.4% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.0 hours of data, or 0.7 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 4.2% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (32,38.6,93)
