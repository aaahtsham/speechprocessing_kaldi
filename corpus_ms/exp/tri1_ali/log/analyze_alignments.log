The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 21.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 85.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 8.6% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 5.0 hours of data, or 3.9 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 4.6% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (11,19.1,58)
