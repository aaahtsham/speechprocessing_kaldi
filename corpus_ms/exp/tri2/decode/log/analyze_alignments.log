The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 21.6% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 86.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 9.5% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.0 hours of data, or 0.8 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 3.9% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (28,35.6,88)
