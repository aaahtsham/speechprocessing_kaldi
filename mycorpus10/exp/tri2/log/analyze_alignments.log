The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 18.3% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 84.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 4.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.1 hours of data, or 0.9 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 2.4% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (8,17.4,48)
