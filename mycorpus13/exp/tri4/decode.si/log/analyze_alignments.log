The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 24.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 81.4% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 7.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.2 hours of data, or 0.1 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 2.5% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (21,27.3,75)
