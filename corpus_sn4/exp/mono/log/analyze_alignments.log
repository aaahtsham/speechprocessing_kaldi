The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 23.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 85.9% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 10.8% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 4.7 hours of data, or 3.6 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 4.2% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (20,29.1,80)
