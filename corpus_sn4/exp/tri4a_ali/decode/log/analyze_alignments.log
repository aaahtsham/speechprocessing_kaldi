The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 15.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 86.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 2.7% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.3 hours of data, or 1.1 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 1.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (7,14.6,45)
