The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 22.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 86.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 10.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 4.7 hours of data, or 3.6 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 4.6% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (14,24.4,76)
