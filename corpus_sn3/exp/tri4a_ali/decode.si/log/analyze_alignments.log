The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 34.5% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 87.4% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 25.2% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 2.0 hours of data, or 1.3 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 9.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (24,37.3,116)
