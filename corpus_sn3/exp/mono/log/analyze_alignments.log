The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 20.6% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 83.2% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 4.9% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 3.9 hours of data, or 3.1 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 1.9% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (16,23.7,59)
