The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 20.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 83.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 4.7% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 3.9 hours of data, or 3.1 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 2.2% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (12,20.2,56)
