The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 17.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 88.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 7.7% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 4.6 hours of data, or 3.8 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 4.8% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (7,18.3,65)
