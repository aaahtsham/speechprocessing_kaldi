The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 19.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 87.9% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 9.3% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 4.6 hours of data, or 3.7 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 4.5% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (13,23.6,74)
