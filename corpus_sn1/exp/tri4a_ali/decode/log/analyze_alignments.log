The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 23.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 81.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 5.7% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.3 hours of data, or 1.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 2.5% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (12,21.5,65)
