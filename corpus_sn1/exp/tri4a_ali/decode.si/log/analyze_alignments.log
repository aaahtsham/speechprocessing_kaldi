The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 23.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 80.9% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 6.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.3 hours of data, or 1.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 2.4% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (12,23.5,77)
