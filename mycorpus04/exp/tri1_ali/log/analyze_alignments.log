The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 15.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 86.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 2.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.1 hours of data, or 0.9 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 0.9% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (19,22.0,49)
